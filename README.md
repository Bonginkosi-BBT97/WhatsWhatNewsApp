# WhatsWhat News App
---
What'sWhatNews is a personal project that has allowed me to expand my skills in iOS development, including working with APIs. It has provided the perfect opportunity to implement new skills, such as utilizing CoreML for sentiment analysis and introducing subscription functionality with StoreKit.

## App Overview:

- **Built with SwiftUI**: What'sWhatNews is developed using SwiftUI, Apple's modern and user-friendly framework for building stunning user interfaces.

- **Kingfisher for Image Handling**: I used KingFisher to efficiently handle images associated with news articles, ensuring a visually appealing and smooth experience.

- **News API Integration**: The app leverages the free version of a news API to fetch news articles from around the world, enabling you to stay informed about what's happening.

- **MVVM Design Pattern**: What'sWhatNews is built following the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern, enhancing code organization and maintainability.

- **CoreML Integration**: CoreML is employed to determine the sentiment of news articles, labeling them as good, neutral, or bad. Good news features a small green dot on the top right, neutral news has a grey dot on the top middle, and bad news is marked with a red dot on the top right side.

- **Filter and Search Features**: You have the flexibility to filter news between "All," "Good," and "Bad" categories. Additionally, you can search for news articles within various categories, including Technology, Business, Sports, and Science.

- **Future Subscriptions**: In the future, we plan to introduce subscription features using StoreKit, allowing you to access even more premium content.

## Getting Started:

To start using What'sWhatNews:

1. Clone this repository.
2. **Important**: As a security measure, we've removed the API key. You will need to obtain your own API key from [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org) and add it to the `NewsManager` class's private API variable in the project.

Now, you're all set to explore, stay informed, and enjoy the benefits of What'sWhatNews. I hope you find this app both informative and educational.
